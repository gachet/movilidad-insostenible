It is likely that different modes of commuting are associated with different wellbeing
outcomes; for example, one study revealed that those who found their

likely to find their journey stressful (Gatersleben and Uzzell, 2007).

Switching to non-car commuting becomes much more likely (9.2 times) as the distance to work drops below three miles
mixed land uses are shown to encourage switches to active commuting (walking and cycling)
